# Project: Enron Dataset Investigation

## Overview
This project involves the investigation of the Enron dataset, one of the most infamous corporate scandals in history. The Enron scandal, which led to the bankruptcy of Enron Corporation and the dissolution of Arthur Andersen LLP, resulted in significant financial and legal repercussions. The dataset contains a vast amount of email communications and financial information related to Enron employees, making it a valuable resource for analyzing patterns of fraud and unethical behavior.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to explore the Enron dataset to uncover insights and patterns that may indicate fraudulent activities or unethical behavior. By analyzing email communications, financial transactions, and other relevant data, we aim to:

- Identify key individuals involved in the scandal
- Uncover suspicious patterns or anomalies in communication and financial data
- Understand the extent of collusion and complicity within the organization
- Gain insights into the methods and strategies used to perpetrate the fraud

## Methodology
The investigation will involve several steps, including:

1. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the structure and content of the Enron dataset, including email metadata, email contents, financial data, and other relevant information.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This may involve data imputation, normalization, and other preprocessing techniques.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing features to extract meaningful insights from the data. This may include sentiment analysis of email content, calculation of financial metrics, and identification of suspicious patterns.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset. This may involve visualizations, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing.

5. **Machine Learning Modeling (Optional)**: Building machine learning models to classify fraudulent activities or predict suspicious behavior based on historical data. This may include anomaly detection, classification, and clustering algorithms.

6. **Interpretation and Reporting**: Interpreting the findings of the investigation and summarizing key insights, conclusions, and recommendations in a report or presentation.

## Dataset
The Enron dataset contains the following types of data:

- **Emails**: Email communications among Enron employees, including metadata such as sender, recipient, timestamp, and subject.
- **Financial Data**: Financial transactions, including salary, bonuses, stock options, and other financial information for Enron employees.
- **Employee Information**: Information about Enron employees, including job titles, departments, and other demographic details.

## Tools and Technologies
The investigation will utilize the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: Python programming language will be used for data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Pandas library will be used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: NumPy library will be used for numerical computations and array operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries will be used for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn library will be used for machine learning modeling and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project will be organized into the following directories and files:

- **README.md**: This document provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, dataset, tools, and project structure.
- **notebooks/**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and interpretation.
